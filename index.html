        <p>This is my page of Indian Food & restaurants in NYC</p>
        <p>Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits. The dishes are then served according to taste in either mild, medium or hot. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions. Some Indian dishes are common in more than one region of India.</p>
